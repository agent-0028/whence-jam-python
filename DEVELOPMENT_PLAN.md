# Development Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the whence-jam-python music recommendation tracking application.

## Phase One: Command Line Application

### Setup Tasks
- [ ] Create `pyproject.toml` with project configuration and dependencies
- [ ] Set up Python project structure with appropriate modules
- [ ] Configure development dependencies (pytest, ruff, etc.)
- [ ] Create virtual environment setup documentation

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement Spotify API integration for music search
- [ ] Design database abstraction layer for future PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Create SQLite database schema and connection handling
- [ ] Build command line interface for adding recommendations
- [ ] Implement listing functionality (chronological, newest first)
- [ ] Add error handling for API failures and invalid inputs

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Create markdown test plan for manual end-to-end testing
- [ ] Document CLI usage and commands

## Phase Two: Web Application

### Web Framework Setup
- [ ] Integrate Flask framework
- [ ] Create HTML templates for forms and listing
- [ ] Set up static file handling for CSS/JS
- [ ] Configure Flask application structure

### Web Features
- [ ] Build web form for song/person input
- [ ] Implement form validation and error handling
- [ ] Create web interface for displaying recommendation list
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile compatibility

### Testing
- [ ] Write integration tests for web routes
- [ ] Create automated end-to-end web tests
- [ ] Test form submission and data persistence

## Phase Three: REST API

### API Development
- [ ] Design REST API endpoints
- [ ] Implement POST endpoint for adding recommendations
- [ ] Create GET endpoint for listing recommendations
- [ ] Add proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- [ ] Implement API authentication if needed

### API Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive API tests
- [ ] Create API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Test API endpoints with various clients

## Cross-Phase Requirements

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Set up continuous linting with ruff
- [ ] Configure type checking with mypy
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage reporting

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Document environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Considerations

- Spotify API rate limiting and error handling
- Database abstraction design to support SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL migration
- SQLite file location and backup strategies
- Configuration management for different environments
- Security considerations for web and API phases
- Performance optimization for large recommendation lists
- Database migration strategy from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
