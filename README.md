An app for knowing who recommended a song or album.

It generated a CLAUDE.md and in the terminal gave me a summary of a plan.

> [CLAUDE]
> I've created a CLAUDE.md file for your repository. The file provides essential information about your music recommendation tracking project, including:
> - Project overview and three-phase development plan
> - Architecture guidelines emphasizing Flask and Python best practices
> - Development setup commands for virtual environments and dependencies
> - Testing requirements from your technical specification
> - Core functionality description
>
> Since this is an early-stage project with no code implementation yet, the file focuses on the architectural foundation from your product and technical specifications rather than specific build commands or detailed code structure.

> Please write a new markdown file listing the tasks you want to do, the plan you just gave me

> I see you have already specified SQLite database. I have updated the tech spec to make this choice explicit and add some details. Please look at 4d2d60b2e6c32ca5575ccf52900a54cfc8e41fd5 and then update your dev plan accordingly if changes are needed.

> For each task in the dev plan, add some notes about how we will verify that the task is complete. Verification does not have to be via a test, it can be from user action like running `ruby --version` to show the correct version is installed. Keep it terse and with an expected audience of an experienced siftware engineer.
